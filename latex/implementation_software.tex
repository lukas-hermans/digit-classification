For the present work, the multiclass kernel perceptron algorithm is implemented in the programming language Python (version 3.8.6).
On top of vanilla Python, the following software is used:
\begin{itemize}
	\item pip (version 21.1.2): managing of Python modules 
	\item matplotlib (version 3.4.2): module for visualization \& plots
	\item numpy (version 1.20.3): module for array computing (such as dot products)
\end{itemize}
All of the Python code used in this paper can be found in the following GitHub repository: \url{https://github.com/lukher98/digit-classification}. To ensure the reproducability of the numerical results, a seed for the random number generator of the numpy module is set at the beginning of the Python code. In addition to the Python code, the repository contains the whole MNIST dataset (using Git Large File Storage), the \LaTeX\ code of this paper, as well as all of the cited papers.

The Python code is executed on a Linux machine, but it should also work on a Mac machine. For Windows, the user might have to change some paths inside the code.
