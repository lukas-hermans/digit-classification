# Digit Classification with Kernel Perceptron
This repository contains the Python code for my project "Digit Classification with the Kernel Perceptron" for the lecture (["Statistical Methods for Machine Learning" ](http://cesa-bianchi.di.unimi.it/MSA/)) at the University of Milan. The project is part of the exam of this course.

The "code" directory includes the Python scripts that implement the kernel perceptron: main.py, data.py, perceptron.py. The script analysis.py contains plots and some analysis programs that are presented in the paper.
