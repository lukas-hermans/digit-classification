Introduction:
- data: grayscale images of digits from 0-9 with 784 pixels (60000 training points, 10000 test points), examplary picture of digits
- objective: train a multiclass kernel perceptron to identify a given handwritten digit
- other algorithms

Theory:
- perceptron = online learning
- standard perceptron algorithm
- kernel perceptron algorithm (extra feature 1 not necessary)
- efficiency of kernel
- relation between alpha and w (do not have to compute w explicitly, which would be impossible)
- multiclass perceptron

Software:
- Python
- pip for package managing
- matplotlib and numpy
- with version number

Results:
- reference to GitHub repository with code
- plot: training & test error against number of epochs (for different degrees)
- plot: training & test error against degrees (for highest epoch) 

Dicussion:

Conclussion:

Code: 
- add best predictor and mean predictor for binary predictors 
- prepare class for multiclass prediction
